# Diablo2QOL
A quality of life mod boosting experience gain, enabling purchasing of runes and boosting drops rates for bosses

## How to install 
Place this mod in your "mods" folder for diablo 2 resurrected. 
Ensure that your game launches with the options "-mod modname -txt". This will ensure that only files needed for the mod are required (i.e. not the entire 30gb)

## Mod features 
- Levels are gained linearly (1000xp * level + exp for previous level)
- Akara now sells rune at the default rune at values specified by the diablo 2 resurrected developers
- Act bosses and superuniques always drop at least one unique and one set item 
- All sets and uniques have the same rareity within their class (e.g. Tyriel's Might is not rarer than any other elite armor)

## For other modders 
- I included the most common tool used to parse the ID-files in diablo 2 resurrected
- The files changed are:
  - experience, misc, setitems, sets, treasureclassex, uniqueitems
